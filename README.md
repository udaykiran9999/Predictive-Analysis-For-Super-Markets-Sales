# Predictive Analysis For Super Markets Sales

Welcome to the Supermarket Sales Predictive Analysis Repository, your one-stop destination for cutting-edge methodologies and insights into forecasting sales trends within the supermarket industry. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource hub for data scientists, analysts, and enthusiasts alike, offering a plethora of tools, algorithms, and case studies to unravel the intricacies of retail sales forecasting.

  Supermarkets face the challenge of optimizing sales performance amidst fluctuating consumer demands, market trends, and external factors. To address this challenge, a predictive analysis framework is needed to forecast supermarket sales accurately. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that can anticipate sales patterns, identify influential factors, and provide actionable insights to enhance revenue generation and operational efficiency.

## Research Questions: 
- How can we predict customer buying patterns using transaction history and demographic data, especially for new or seasonal products?
- What machine learning models best optimize supply chain logistics to reduce waste and ensure the availability of high-demand products?
- How did the COVID-19 pandemic alter purchasing behaviours, and how can we use this data to forecast future market disruptions?

## Methodology: 
- Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
  - The Dataset is stored in an Excel Spreadsheet containing the information of weekly retail food sales by product subcategory.
  - The data can be processed to reveal comparative insights based on  the market dynamics.
  - Segmentation of the market products that exhibit distinct preferences leads to refinement of the research question aiming at specific products.
  - Sales data along with customer machine can be used to optimize product placements, promotions, and cross selling strategies in retail environments!

- Supervised Learning Approach.
- ### Feature Engineering:
  - Engineered relevant features such as seasonality, holidays, and lag variables to capture temporal and spatial dependencies in sales data. 
- ### Model Selection:
  - Evaluated various regression models including Linear Regression, SVR, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. 
- ### Model Evaluation:
  - Utilized cross-validation techniques to assess model performance based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) scores. 
- ### Model Tuning:
  - Optimized hyperparameters for the selected model (Gradient Boosting Regressor) to further enhance predictive accuracy.
